  "description": "\"Not yet, no?\" EP - a collaboration between musicians Tobilla, Static Res, Kahlil Newton & WhoKares, Executive Produced by Web3 native sweetman.eth. While everyone has roots stretching back to  Columbus, Ohio over half a decade ago, this project was created over the web, with collaborators in Ohio, DC and Argentina.\n \n“Not yet, no?” is the group’s genesis music nft built as a collaborative EP player, powered by decentralized protocols.\n\nThis 5-track EP features one track from each musician, as well as a closer that features in put from everyone. It is the first of its kind for all four artists, marking the beginning of a new era of merging art and technology for all involved. While everyone was able to contribute what they saw fit, there is a cohesive underline highlighted by the title: “Not yet, no?”. It's a hesitation, a question of one’s role and timing. \n\nIn “Up at Night” Static Res deals with the ruminations and self doubt imposed by a failed relationship, warning an unnamed woman not to get too close. It’s a sobering example of the effects vulnerability can have on one's psyche. While Kahlil also explores the remnants of a failed relationship in “TrynaGetAReadOnYa V.1 2.09.23”, his verse quickly devolves into a sonic exercise in masking the pain in a false bravado. While he croons on the hook “you broke my heart last vacation”, in the verse he finds himself making empty comparisons to strong male archetypal figures such as Michael Corleone. Wrapping it all together with “Dreamer 2000”, Nook creates a soundscape reminiscent of the 2000s with a modern flip. Again we get bravado, this time provided by a sample of Soulja Boy’s “Pretty Boy Swag”, followed by Huey’s “Pop Lock and Drop it”. Several other songs in a similar vein are incorporated, all over dreamy chords and an infectious drum pattern, creating a cognitive dissonance between the hyper sexual and ego fueled, and the sad loneliness underlining it all.  And with “Rebel 2 the Bone” Tobilla stands defiant against the powers at be, standing confidently in himself and his team, declaring himself and in extension everyone else involved in this project a rebel. Of course it strikes a cord, considering the exploration into such a disruptive field as Web3. A disruption that shouldn't be overlooked- By releasing in such a form the group is rebelling against the stagnant system of DSPs and traditional labels. And by participating in this release, we all, in our own way, have signed up for the rebellion. \n\nOf course all of this wouldn’t have been achievable without the guiding hand of sweetman.eth, the music nft engineer and executive producer of this collaboration. With an extensive history of onboarding artists in Latin America into web3, he has described this project as a treat and a fruition of a journey he decided to take long ago: the goal of ushering musicians into Web 3 and helping them redefine a new relationship with their music, and even further, their support base. Of course, it’s a bit special because this time he’s doing what he does best with some of his closest friends back home. By collecting this Project, you are part of the vanguard of a new world for them, and collecting the first of many endeavors in this space.",
